                SWIFT FIXER - INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

Thank you for downloading Swift Fixer!

Please carefully follow the steps below to ensure the tool works correctly on your system. This tool is designed to repair or optimize your Swift installation, and must be used with administrative permissions.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: RUN THE PROGRAM AS ADMINISTRATOR
------------------------------------------------------------
Before doing anything else, you MUST run the file as an administrator.

Here's how:

1. Locate the Swift Fixer .exe file that you downloaded.
2. Right-click on the file.
3. From the context menu, select **"Run as Administrator"**.
4. If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click **"Yes"** to allow it.

‚ö†Ô∏è Why is this important?
Running the tool as an administrator gives it the necessary permissions to access and modify system files or settings that are otherwise restricted. If you skip this step, the fixer may not work correctly, or it might fail completely.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: CLICK THE ‚ÄúSWIFT FIXER‚Äù BUTTON INSIDE THE APP
------------------------------------------------------------
Once the program window opens, you'll see a simple interface with a button labeled **‚ÄúSwift Fixer‚Äù**.

Please do the following:

1. Click the ‚ÄúSwift Fixer‚Äù button ONCE.
2. Wait a few moments while the tool performs its operations.
3. You may see status updates or messages in the window (if enabled).
4. Please **do not close the program** or click the button multiple times during this process.

The process is automatic ‚Äî you do not need to do anything else.

------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: YOU‚ÄôRE DONE ‚Äî ENJOY!
------------------------------------------------------------
After the process completes, your Swift installation should now be fixed or optimized based on what this tool is designed to do.

You should now notice improved performance or restored functionality (depending on the issue that was being addressed). If no errors appear, the fix was successful.

Once done:
- You may safely close the application.
- In most cases, no reboot is required ‚Äî but if you're unsure, restarting your PC is always a good idea.

ADDITIONAL NOTES & TROUBLESHOOTING

üìå Antivirus Warning?
Some antivirus software may falsely detect this file as harmful. This is a **false positive** ‚Äî the tool is safe to use. If this happens:

1. Temporarily disable your antivirus software before running the program.
2. Re-enable it after the fix is complete.
3. You can also add the file to your antivirus ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù list if needed.

üí° Still Not Working?
- Make sure you are **actually running as Administrator**.
- If nothing happens after clicking ‚ÄúSwift Fixer,‚Äù try again after disabling antivirus.
